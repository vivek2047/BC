SRE part 

1.Whats is the architecture - For minimum downtime have DR startegy , multi node set up for max performance 

2.BAckup -- Backup the data -l0 every weekend , l1 every day 

3.Monitor the setup - have warning and critical thresholds for FS space usage , memeory usage at server level 

4.Application query performance can be improved if slow by indexing or execution plan set up 

5.Upgrade the infrastructure for security and performance , downtime may be needed for this 

6.Application connections are most difficult to predict since we dont know how the user is isuing the app 

SLO/SLI 

Use of monitoring tools like Prometheus greatly helps , have system level monitoring for Filesystem,memory usage , IO etc

Have a service level aggrements with clients and user - based on severity divide the incidents into sev 1 , sev 2 and sev 3 with a timeframe against each to come to solution 

Minimize the down time , it should be the main objective as a SRE team
